<p> <b>CREATIVITY</b>drives everything we do.<br> It pushes us to think outside of the box.<br> To innovate.<br>
     To challenge the status quo.<br> To keep us from falling into the “that’s how we’ve always done it” 
     mentality.<br> To ensure that we’re constantly evolving and improving – with a determined bias for action.<br>
      We are confident enough to take on any endeavor, <br>but also humble enough to know that there is always 
      room for<br> improvement.<br><br>


<b>DIVERSITY</b> AND <b>INCLUSION</b><br> are fundamental because we know that like great music,<br> success requires bringing
 together diverse voices. We strive to be as inclusive as the music and creators we represent. We prize the 
 individual but we celebrate the team.<br><br>


Everything we do, we do with <b>INTEGRITY</b>.<br> Our communication is candid and respectful.<br> Our work is always
 guided by what is best for the music community.<br> It must be grounded in candor, while fostering a respectful
  environment where<br> <b>COLLABORATION</b><br> thrives and great ideas take flight.<br><br>


But if you really want to understand what drives us,<br> it’s <b>PASSION</b>.<br> We love music and every single person,
 place or thing that touches it.<br> That’s why we do it.<br> And that’s the kind of group we want to be a part of. </p>
